% --- Burnup points for the burnup calculation (in MWd/kgU)
%     Too long intervals between the burnup points will decrease the
%     accuracy of the burnup calculation, especially during the burn-out 
%     of burnable absorber

% --- Material division for burnup calculation
%     Treat different pins of fuelNoGad as separate depletion zones (sep 1)

% --- Material division for burnup calculation
%     Treat different pins of fuelYesGad as separate depletion zones (sep 1)
%     additionally divide each of those fuel pellets into 10 equal volume rings
%     between radial coordinates of 0.0 and 0.3975

% --- Calculate material volumes before simulation by
%     sampling 10 million random points in the geometry.
%     Specifying the material volumes is crucial in burnup calculations

% set mcvol 10000000

% --- Nuclide inventory: these nuclides will be included in the
%     depletion output file burn_dep.m. The list can be changed
%     after the simulation has concluded if needed. Then you can run
%     sss2 -rdep burn
%     which will make Serpent re-read the inventory and re-produce the
%     depletion output file.

% --- Use predictor corrector method for the depletion solution
%     leli: Linear extrapolation on predictor
%           Linear interpolation on corrector
%     10 10: 10 substeps on predictor, 10 substeps on corrector

set pcc leli 10 10


% --- Reduce unionized energy grid size in order to save some memory
%     Use grid thinning with 5e-5 reconstruction tolerance between
%     1e-9 and 15 MeV.
